# This placeholder is intentionally minimal.
# Generate the real lockfile with Poetry in your environment to include:
# - resolved versions for your OS/arch
# - file hashes for integrity
# - markers and extras

# --- How to generate (run in project root) ---
# 1) poetry env use 3.11
# 2) poetry lock --no-update
# 3) poetry install --no-root
#
# For CI reproducibility:
#   POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=true poetry lock --no-update
#   poetry export -f requirements.txt --with-hashes -o requirements.lock.txt
