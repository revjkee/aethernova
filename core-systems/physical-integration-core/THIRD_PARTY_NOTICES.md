# Third‑Party Notices
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

This project may include or depend on software developed by third parties. This document provides attribution and license information as required by the respective licenses.

> Important:
> - This file is generated and maintained as part of the compliance workflow. Do not edit the auto‑generated section manually.

## Scope

The notices apply to:
- Runtime artifacts (containers, wheels, jars, binaries) published from this repository.
- Embedded assets (fonts, icons, small datasets) where license requires attribution.
- Build‑time tools only if they are redistributed with the artifact.

## How this file is produced

The “Notices by Component” and “License Texts” sections are populated by CI using an OSS license scanner (e.g., ORT, Syft/Grype, pip‑licenses, npm‑license‑crawler, cargo‑about, go‑licenses) and normalized to SPDX. The scanner output is deduplicated by package name and version. If a license mandates inclusion of its full text (e.g., Apache‑2.0, BSD‑2/3‑Clause, MPL‑2.0, EPL‑2.0), the corresponding text is embedded below.
